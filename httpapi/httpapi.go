// Package httpapi serves a multi-turn agent CONVERSATION over HTTP.
//
// The unit of the API is a session, and a session owns a conversation rather
// than a single run. That is the whole reason this package exists as an
// [http.Handler] instead of as another command: a run is over in a minute, a
// conversation is what a person actually has, and every hard problem here —
// resuming a stream across a turn boundary, answering a permission prompt
// that is parked in a dispatcher, reaping what nobody came back for — is a
// lifecycle problem. A lifecycle you can only test through a socket is one
// nobody tests, so [Manager] is HTTP-free and [New] is a thin projection of it
// onto a resource model:
//
//	GET    /api/health                            {status, version, uptime_sec}
//	GET    /api/config                            what this server offers
//	POST   /api/sessions                          create; {prompt, ...} in the body
//	GET    /api/sessions                          list
//	GET    /api/sessions/{id}                     one SessionInfo
//	DELETE /api/sessions/{id}                     cancel and drop
//	GET    /api/sessions/{id}/events              SSE, Last-Event-ID resume
//	GET    /api/sessions/{id}/messages            the transcript
//	POST   /api/sessions/{id}/messages            continue the conversation
//	GET    /api/sessions/{id}/approvals           what is waiting on a human
//	POST   /api/sessions/{id}/approvals/{use_id}  {"allow": true|false}
//	GET    /metrics                               with [WithMetrics]
//
// Sequence numbers are global to the SESSION, not to the run. A UI that
// reconnects across a turn boundary therefore resumes into the same numbering
// it left, instead of silently losing the earlier turn to a stream that
// restarted at zero.
//
// Every error has the same shape, so a UI can branch on a bounded token
// instead of parsing prose:
//
//	{"error": {"kind": "no_such_session", "message": "…"}}
