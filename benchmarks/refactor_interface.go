// refactorInterface is the "edit the files nobody told you about" task.
//
// The prompt names exactly one identifier — the Stage interface — and one
// method to add to it. It names none of the five types that satisfy Stage, and
// one of those five lives in the TEST file, which an agent that only greps the
// non-test sources will miss and then spend its remaining turns failing to
// build. Finding them is the task; the Go compiler is the grader, so there is
// nothing to argue about.
//
// The new method is chosen so its correct value is DERIVABLE rather than
// decreed. `Idempotent() bool` is a property of code the agent can read, not a
// number the prompt has to supply per type, which is what lets the probe check
// the answers mechanically: for every stage it compares the declared value
// against what actually happens when Process runs twice. An agent that adds
// the method and returns true everywhere compiles, passes the shipped tests,
// and scores zero on the probe.
//
// The probe is also what forces the INTERFACE change rather than five
// unrelated methods: it calls s.Idempotent() through a []Stage, which does not
// compile unless the method is on the interface.

Add one method to the ` + "`Stage`" + ` interface:

    // Idempotent reports whether running Process twice on the same input
    // gives the same result as running it once.
    Idempotent() bool

Every type that satisfies Stage has to gain it, and the value each one returns
must be the truth about that type: a stage whose Process really is idempotent
returns true, one whose Process is not returns false. Work that out by reading
what each Process does.

This prompt does not tell you which types those are, or which files they are
in. Find them.

Do not change what Name or Process already do, and do not add dependencies.
