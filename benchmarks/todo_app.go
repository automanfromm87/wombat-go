// todoApp is the greenfield task and the hardest of the four: an empty
// directory, a go.mod, and a program to write from nothing.
//
// The fixture is one file. go.mod is provided rather than left to the agent
// for a hermeticity reason and not a kindness one — `go mod init` is fine, but
// an agent that instead runs `go mod tidy` against GOPROXY=off spends turns on
// an error that has nothing to do with the task. Handing it a module with no
// requires makes "standard library only" the path of least resistance.
//
// Five verifiers, weighted so that vet/build/test/a-test-file together are
// worth less than the one check that the program actually does the job:
// `go build` passing on a CLI that stores nothing is not partial credit for a
// todo list, it is partial credit for compiling.

		Summary: "write a persistent todo CLI from scratch, with tests",
		Prompt: `Write a command-line todo application in Go, in this directory.

go.mod already exists (module todo). Use the standard library only — do not add
dependencies, and do not run ` + "`go get`" + `, there is no module proxy here.

Requirements:
- package main at the module root, so ` + "`go run .`" + ` works.
- Three subcommands:
  - ` + "`add <text>`" + ` — add a todo item.
  - ` + "`list`" + ` — print every item, one per line. Each line must contain
    that item's text.
  - ` + "`done <n>`" + ` — mark item n complete; ` + "`list`" + ` must show it
    as complete afterwards.
- Items persist between runs in a JSON file in the current working directory,
  so ` + "`add`" + ` in one process is visible to ` + "`list`" + ` in the next.
- At least one ` + "`*_test.go`" + ` file, testing something real.
- ` + "`go vet ./...`" + `, ` + "`go build ./...`" + ` and ` + "`go test ./...`" + `
  must all pass.`,
