// NeedleFileCount is how many daily logs the haystack holds.

// Sized against the transcript and not against a round number: 44 logs at
// roughly 700 bytes each is ~30KB of text, which is comfortably readable file
// by file and comfortably NOT readable inside a 24-turn episode that also has
// to think. An agent that opens them one at a time runs out of turns; one that
// cats the directory runs out of context. Either failure is the measurement.

// way.

//
// The fact is in one file out of 44 and the question does not quote it. What
// makes it more than a grep is the distractor structure: five logs mention a
// rollback and six mention settlement, and only one mentions both. A single
// grep for either word returns a handful of files that all look plausible, so
// the agent has to narrow rather than guess, and an agent that decides to just
// read everything will not finish.
//
// Nothing here needs the Go toolchain, which — like read-only-qa — makes it
// the hard-tier task to run when you want to know whether the harness works
// rather than whether the agent does.
