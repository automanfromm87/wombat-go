// crossFileBug separates the symptom from the cause.
//
// What fails is TestStoreSpellingsAreOneRecord in store_test.go. What is wrong
// is normalizeKey in index.go, two calls away: the test drives Store.Put and
// Store.Len, Store delegates to Index.Add, and Index.Add is what calls the
// broken helper. Nothing in store.go is wrong, and the failure message names
// only store.go's types.
//
// The bug itself is a doc comment that describes three rules and code that
// implements two: normalizeKey promises lower case, trimmed ends AND collapsed
// internal whitespace, and does not collapse. That shape is deliberate — it is
// found by reading rather than by guessing, and the fix is unambiguous because
// the doc comment already says what the function is for.
//
// # The attractor
//
// The cheap fix is to normalise in Store.Put and Store.Get. It turns the one
// failing test green in thirty seconds, and it leaves Index — which is
// exported, and has its own tests — broken for the next caller. Two verifiers
// exist to price that:
//
//   - [Unchanged] on store.go, which is the file the prompt says is correct.
//     A checksum, not a heuristic: any edit at all fails it.
//   - a [GoProbe] that drives Index directly and never touches Store, so it
//     can only pass if normalizeKey itself was fixed.
//
// So the symptom patch scores 0.40 and a real fix scores 1.00, and the two are
// distinguishable in the breakdown rather than only in the total.

Two rules, and between them they are the task:

- store.go and store_test.go are both correct. Do NOT modify either one — not
  one byte. The failing test is a symptom; what it is a symptom of lives
  somewhere they call.
- Fix it at the source. Normalising the key inside store.go would turn this
  one test green and leave the same bug waiting for every other caller, so it
  does not count as a fix here.

Do not add dependencies. ` + "`go test ./...`" + ` must pass when you are done.`,

## Key canonicalisation

Keys come from labels people type, so two users will spell the same key
differently: different case, stray spaces at the ends, and — the one that
keeps biting us — more than one space in the middle.

The rule is: lower case, trim the ends, collapse every internal run of
whitespace to one space. It lives in exactly one function so that Put, Get and
anything added later cannot disagree about it. Do not re-implement it at a
call site; that is how we ended up with two records for "Order Total" the
first time.
