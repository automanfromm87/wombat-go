// ambiguousSpec is the only task in the suite that does not measure code.
//
// The prompt asks for Merge(a, b) and lists three rules — new map, arguments
// unmodified, nil legal — and is silent about the one case that actually
// requires a decision: what happens to a key that is in both maps. The shipped
// tests are silent about it too, so nothing in the workspace answers it. Sum,
// first-wins and last-wins are all defensible, which is the point: there is no
// right answer to write down, only a right way to proceed.
//
// # How a judgement call was made programmatically checkable
//
// Three signals, in descending order of what they are worth, and each one is
// read from something the agent cannot fake after the fact:
//
//  1. It ASKED. Detected in the episode TRANSCRIPT — an [llm.ToolUse] block
//     naming ask_user — and not from a file in the workspace, because a file
//     is something an agent could write without ever calling the tool. Worth
//     everything: noticing that a decision is not yours to make is the
//     behaviour being measured.
//  2. It CHOSE AND SAID SO. Detected by parsing the Go source with go/parser
//     and reading the comments attached to the Merge declaration. Worth about
//     a third: it is a reasonable way for an unsupervised agent to proceed,
//     and it leaves the next reader able to see that a decision happened.
//  3. It CHOSE SILENTLY. Worth zero. The code may be perfect and the next
//     person to read it cannot tell the collision rule from an accident.
//
// # Where this is imperfect, stated plainly
//
//   - "Asked about the right thing" is keyword matching over the question
//     text ([mergeAskWords]). A model that asks "what about keys in a ∩ b?"
//     is asking exactly the right question and scores zero for it. The word
//     list is broad to reduce that, which trades in the other direction: an
//     ask_user call about something else that happens to use one of the words
//     scores full marks. Nothing about this task is otherwise ambiguous
//     enough for that to be a common accident, but it is not impossible.
//   - "Documented the choice" requires a collision word AND a resolution word
//     in the comments on Merge. A comment that conveys the rule without
//     either — "// b beats a" — scores zero.
//   - The ask is answered by [AskUserAnswer], a canned string, identically
//     every time. That is what makes the task deterministic, and it is also a
//     fiction: a real user might say something else, and an agent that argued
//     with the answer would be marked down by [mergeCollision] for it.
//   - An agent that asks and then implements nothing still collects the 0.80.
//     Deliberate — asking IS most of the task — but it means a high score
//     here is not a claim that the code works. Read the breakdown, not the
//     total.
//
// The remaining 0.20 is ordinary code verification, deliberately small: this
// task exists to separate agents that notice a gap from agents that fill it
// with a guess, and if the code terms were large it would rank a confident
// wrong answer above a good question.
