// Package permission decides whether a tool call is allowed to run, and asks a
// human when the answer is "it depends".
//
// # Why this exists
//
// The harness already had a guardrail: builtin.OSFS(root) confines the file
// tools to a subtree. It constrains view_file and write_file and it does
// exactly nothing to bash — which was demonstrated live, in one run, when
// view_file was refused for /etc/hosts and the model read the same file with
// `cat /etc/hosts` on the next turn. A guardrail that one tool walks around is
// not a guardrail, it is a UX affordance with a security-sounding name.
//
// The fix is not a better path parser. It is admitting that some calls cannot
// be judged by the harness at all and must be put in front of a person. So the
// verdict has three values, not two: [Allow], [Deny] and [Ask].
//
// # How it fits together
//
//	p := permission.Workspace("/work")
//	h := tool.Chain(inner, permission.Gate(p, approver))
//
// A [Policy] is an ordered list of [Rule]s and a fallback. [Gate] turns a
// policy into tool middleware: it resolves the verdict, blocks on the
// [Approver] when the verdict is [Ask], emits [Requested] and [Decided] for a
// UI, logs every decision through slog, and refuses the call with an error the
// model can act on.
//
// # Fail closed
//
// [Undecided] is the zero [Decision] and means "this rule has no opinion".
// A Policy whose rules all decline falls back to Policy.Default — and a zero
// Default is Undecided, which [Policy.Decide] resolves to [Deny]. So the
// zero Policy denies everything. That is deliberate: the failure mode of a
// half-configured permission system must be refusal, never permission.

// individual halves are called. A tool that declares no capability at all is
// refused too: undeclared is not the same as harmless.

			},
		},
		Default: Deny,
	}
}

// Workspace confines a run to root: reads and writes inside it are free,
// everything else goes in front of a person.
//
// Precisely: CapMeta allows, a self-contained read-only tool allows, an
// obviously harmless shell command allows, any other CapExec asks, paths
// inside root allow, and anything left over asks.
//
// # The order, and why it is this order
//
//  1. CapMeta first. delegate and load_skill spawn a sub-agent or paste text
//     into the transcript; the sub-agent's own calls are gated by its own
//     chain. Asking about the orchestration itself trains the human to click
//     yes, which is the only real failure mode of an approval prompt.
//
//  2. Then the tools that touch nothing — a calculator, a clock. They cannot
//     be "inside" or "outside" a directory, and without this they would fall
//     through to the default and interrupt a person to ask about arithmetic.
//
//  3. Then [SafeCommands], which allows `go test ./...` and its two hundred
//     spellings without a prompt. It must come before the CapExec rule below,
//     because that rule asks about every shell call and the first decisive
//     rule wins. SafeCommands never denies, so putting it here can only turn
//     an Ask into an Allow — never the reverse — and everything it does not
//     recognise falls straight into step 4. Read its limitations: it is a
//     heuristic over a string, and it is the one rule in this policy that
//     makes the answer less conservative than it was.
//
//  4. Then CapExec, which ASKS. It has to come before the path rule so the
//     reason a person reads is about the shell command rather than about
//     whichever incidental path argument the call happened to carry. See
//     [FSRoot] for why a shell command cannot be judged any other way.
//
//  5. Then the path check, which is [FSRoot] with its Deny softened to Ask:
//     inside root is allowed outright, and outside root is a question rather
//     than a refusal. That is the difference between this policy and
//     [FSRoot] used alone — a workspace is a default, not a wall.
//
//  6. Default Ask. Network calls, pause tools, anything a rule did not
//     recognise: the human decides.
//
// Note that a read OUTSIDE root asks rather than being free. Reading
// ~/.aws/credentials is a read, and the whole point of a workspace is that it
// bounds the run in both directions.
//
// root is resolved to an absolute path when the policy is built; see [FSRoot]
// for the containment check's limits, which are real.
