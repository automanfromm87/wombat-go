// # Waiting happens here, not in the agent loop
//
// The obvious design is to pause the run, hand the question up to the caller
// and resume — and it does not work. A paused run has to answer the pending
// tool_use before the conversation can continue, so the approval itself
// becomes the tool's result: the model reads "yes" where it expected the
// contents of the file, and the tool never runs at all. Answering "yes, now
// really run it" needs a second turn and a second model call to get back to a
// call the model already made.
//
// Blocking inside the middleware keeps the call PENDING while the human
// thinks. When the answer arrives the tool executes and its real output
// becomes the tool_result. The transcript then contains the file, and no
// mention of the approval anywhere — which is correct, because the approval is
// the operator's business and not part of the model's reasoning.
//
// What unblocks a wait that is never answered is cancellation, which the
// harness already has everywhere: a governor abort, a wall-clock cap, a
// disconnected browser. Such a wait returns context.Cause(ctx), not a denial,
// because an abandoned question was never refused.
//

// OUTSIDE retry and the circuit breaker: a denial is a verdict, not a
// transient failure, and retrying it would ask a person the same question
// three times with exponential backoff between. It would also let a refused
// call count toward tripping the breaker, taking out a tool that never
// misbehaved. INSIDE observation, so a refused call still produces exactly one
// Start/Done pair and shows up in the trace as the thing that happened — a
// call that vanishes from the UI because it was refused is how an operator
// concludes the harness is broken.
//
// Where it sits relative to tool.WithTimeout is a real choice. Inside means
// the tool's own timeout also bounds the human's thinking time, which is
// usually wrong: a 30-second cap on view_file is about the read, not about
// lunch. Prefer to install Gate outside the timeout and bound the wait with
// the run's own budget.
