// Grants remembers per-run approvals so the same question is asked once.
//
// Per-run, not per-agent, for the reason skill.State is: a wombat.Agent is
// immutable and shared across goroutines, so approvals stored on it would leak
// between concurrent runs — one user saying yes would answer for everybody.
// Grants travel on the context instead, which also means a sub-agent that
// inherits the context inherits its parent's answers, which is what a person
// who approved the parent's task expects.
//
// # What counts as "the same question"
//
// A grant is keyed on the tool name AND the exact arguments (see [Gate]).
// Approving `rm -rf /tmp/build` must not approve `rm -rf /`, and no textual
// similarity measure is trustworthy enough to decide the two are the same
// question. So the memory is narrow on purpose: it stops the second identical
// call — a retry, a loop the model has fallen into, the same file written
// twice — from interrupting a person again, and nothing more.
//
// A broader standing permission is a policy decision, not an approval one:
// express "bash is fine today" as [AllowTools] in the [Policy], where it is
// written down and reviewable, rather than as a grant that widens invisibly.
