// `go test ./...` and does not admit `go testify`. Entries are deliberately
// specific where a program has both harmless and destructive subcommands, so
// this list carries "git status" and "git log" rather than "git".
//
// What is missing is the interesting part. rm, mv and cp change the tree; curl
// and wget reach the network and can write a file; chmod and sudo change who
// may do what; npm and pip execute arbitrary code out of a lockfile before
// they print anything; git push, git commit and git checkout publish or
// destroy work. None of those is "recognisably harmless", so none is here and
// all of them keep going to a person.
//
// A caller that wants more passes extra arguments to [SafeCommands] rather
// than appending here: the variable is read once, when a rule is built, and a
// package-level slice mutated at runtime is a permission change nobody can
// review.

// SafeCommands allows a shell command that is recognisably harmless.
//
// A grant is keyed on the tool name and the FULL arguments (see [Grants]), so
// `go test -v ./... | head -100` and `go test ./... -v` are two different
// questions and both get asked. That is correct and it is exhausting: a
// measured run of one incremental coding task stopped for a human five times,
// and three of those were variations on `go test` and `go build`. This rule
// exists to delete that particular noise and nothing else.
//
// A command is allowed only if ALL of the following hold. Otherwise the answer
// is [Undecided] and the policy falls through to whatever asks a person. This
// rule NEVER returns [Deny]: its job is to remove noise, not to add refusals,
// and a heuristic that can refuse is a heuristic that can break a run it does
// not understand.
//
//  1. The command matches an allowlisted prefix on a word boundary. Matching
//     is by word, so "go test" admits `go test ./...` and not `go testify`,
//     and `sudo go test` matches nothing because the first word is not "go".
//
//  2. The command contains no shell metacharacter AT ALL — see
//     [shellMetacharacters]. This is the load-bearing check. `go test; rm -rf
//     /` starts with an allowlisted prefix, and without this the allowlist is
//     not a convenience, it is an exploit: every entry becomes a prefix an
//     attacker (or a prompt-injected model, which behaves like one) glues a
//     real command onto. Tilde goes the same way, for the reason on
//     [pathExpansionChars].
//
//  3. Every absolute path appearing as a token is inside root, and no token
//     contains a ".." element. Relative tokens are not resolved and do not
//     need to be: with ".." refused they cannot climb out of the directory the
//     command runs in, and rule 4 puts that directory inside root.
//
//  4. exec_dir, if present, is inside root.
//
// # What this is NOT
//
// Loudly, because the failure mode of a safety feature nobody understands is
// an operator who thinks they are protected.
//
// This is a heuristic over a string. It does not parse the shell, it does not
// know what any program on the list actually does with its arguments, and it
// cannot follow a path through a variable, a config file or a symlink. A
// program on the allowlist can itself be a shell: `echo` cannot run anything,
// `find` very much can, which is why [unsafeFlags] exists and why that map is
// a patch and not a proof. `tail -f` never returns. `grep -r` reads every file
// under the directory it is pointed at, and the whole point of rule 3 is that
// it can only be pointed inside root — textually, with no symlink resolution,
// exactly like [FSRoot], with exactly the same TOCTOU race.
//
// It exists so that nobody is asked about `go test` twenty times in one
// afternoon. Anything it cannot prove obvious falls through to a human, and
// real containment is a container.
//
// root must not be empty and is resolved to an absolute path when the rule is
// built; both are construction-time programmer errors and panic.

// pipeline splits a command into the stages a shell would run, and reports
// false for anything it will not reason about.
//
// The reason this exists is that the rule it serves was, in practice, off. The
// original check refused a command containing ANY shell metacharacter, which is
// the safe reading and also excludes how models actually write shell:
// `go test ./... 2>&1 | head -n 300`. In a live run under the workspace policy,
// an agent that had just written its implementation could not run its own tests
// — two of those in a row, and the refusal did not say why, so it tried
// `echo hi; pwd; ls -la` next and hit the same wall. An allowlist that never
// fires is not a safety feature, it is a rule that turns every exec into a
// question a headless front end cannot answer.
//
// So two constructs are admitted, and only two:
//
//   - "|" between stages. Each stage is then checked in full and independently:
//     `go test ./... | head -300` needs BOTH "go test" and "head" on the list.
//     `go test ./... | sh` does not get past the second stage. This is safe in a
//     way that a prefix match over the whole string never was — the failure it
//     replaces is `go test; rm -rf /`, where the dangerous half was never
//     examined at all.
//   - The exact token "2>&1". It duplicates a file descriptor and cannot name a
//     file, which is what makes it different from every other redirect. It is
//     removed before the stage is tokenised so that ">" and "&" can stay
//     forbidden everywhere else.
//
// Everything else still fails: ";" and "&&" and "||" sequence, "$()" and
// backticks substitute, ">" and "<" touch files, "&" backgrounds, "~" expands
// to a path this rule cannot see. All of them return false, the rule returns
// Undecided, and a person gets asked — which is the behaviour every one of them
// had before.
//
// "||" deserves its own note: splitting naively on "|" would turn
// `go test || rm -rf /` into the stages "go test" and "| rm -rf /", and a
// leading empty stage is easy to mishandle. It is rejected outright, before any
// split, by looking for the doubled byte.
