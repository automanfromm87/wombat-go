// pathArgs are the input keys FSRoot reads as filesystem paths.
//
// A fixed list rather than a heuristic over key names. Guessing from the key

// added, and the failure would be a permitted write nobody asked for. The
// order is fixed too, so the reason attached to a decision is the same on
// every run for the same call.

// FSRoot confines path arguments to root, and refuses to guess about shells.
//
// For a tool that declares [tool.NeedFSRead] or [tool.NeedFSWrite], the input
// is decoded as an object and the string-valued keys named in [pathArgs] are
// compared against root: every path inside allows, any path outside denies. A
// declared-filesystem tool whose call names no path at all is [Undecided] —
// there is nothing to judge, and inventing a verdict would be a guess.
//
// For a [tool.CapExec] tool the answer is [Ask], always, and the reason says
// why in plain words: what a shell command will touch cannot be decided by
// reading it. `cat $F`, `make`, `git clean -xdf`, a script that reads a
// config, anything with a pipe — the paths are not in the string. Every
// attempt to pattern-match them is a filter an adversary (or a
// prompt-injected model, which behaves like one) walks around, and worse, it
// tells the operator they are protected. Asking is the honest verdict, and it
// is the reason this package exists at all: the -sandbox flag constrains the
// file tools and does nothing whatsoever to bash.
//
// # The containment check is textual and symlink-blind
//
// Loudly, because this is the same check [builtin.OSFS] does and it has the
// same limits. Containment is filepath.Clean followed by a prefix test.
// Clean resolves "." and ".." lexically, so /work/../etc/passwd is caught —
// but nothing here touches the disk. Symlinks are NOT resolved: a symlink
// under root pointing outside it escapes, and so do hardlinks, bind mounts,
// and the race between this check and the syscall that follows it (TOCTOU).
// A relative path is interpreted against root, which is what the harness tells
// the model to do with relative paths anyway.
//
// This is a guardrail against a model casually wandering out of its
// workspace. It is not an isolation boundary. Real isolation is a container, a
// chroot, a mount namespace — and if you have one, you do not need to read
// path arguments at all.
//
// root must not be empty and is resolved to an absolute path when the rule is
// built; both are construction-time programmer errors and panic.
