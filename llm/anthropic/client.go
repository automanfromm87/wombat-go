// # Why there is no subprocess here
//
// The OCaml original spawned curl and re-implemented HTTP on top of it: a
// pipe pair per call, a hand-rolled Unix.select line reader to get first-byte
// and idle deadlines, a status-line parser that had to cope with proxy CONNECT
// responses interleaved in the same stdout, and a waitpid to recover the exit
// code. All of that is deleted. net/http already gives us, for free and
// correctly: connection reuse, proxy support ([Config.Proxy] or the standard
// proxy environment variables), per-phase timeouts on the Transport, and a body
// that unblocks the moment the request context is cancelled — which is also how
// [governor] enforces a budget. The one thing the standard library does not
// give us is a mid-body idle deadline, so exactly that one thing is rebuilt
// here, in six lines, with a time.AfterFunc that cancels the request context.
//
// # Prompt caching
//
// This client places three cache_control breakpoints — system, tool list, last
// message — and their placement is load-bearing. See request.go: getting it
// wrong does not fail, it silently doubles the bill.
//
// # Concurrency
//
// A Client is immutable after [New] and safe for concurrent use; sub-agents
// fanned across goroutines share one client and one connection pool.
