// Command wombat-serve is an agent you can hold a conversation with over HTTP.
//
//	go run ./cmd/wombat-serve
//	open http://localhost:8080
//
// Everything about sessions, streaming and approvals lives in
// [github.com/automanfromm87/wombat-go/httpapi], which is an [http.Handler] and
// is tested without a socket. What is left here is the part that genuinely
// belongs to a command: reading flags, building one provider client, and
// deciding what an agent is allowed to do — per session, because the directory
// the file tools are rooted at and the policy that gates them are exactly the
// choices a client makes when it starts a conversation.
//
// The previous version of this command was a one-shot-turn demo: a session was
// a single run, the prompt rode in a query string, and a page that reloaded
// had lost everything. See the httpapi package for the resource model that
// replaced it.
