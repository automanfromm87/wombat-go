		Description: `Pause the agent and ask the user via a structured form. The front-end renders the form from a JSON Schema you supply; the user's answer arrives back as a JSON object matching that schema. Use this when you genuinely need user input on a decision that materially changes downstream work — don't guess, don't ask trivial questions.

PREFERRED INPUT — pass a JSON Schema in [schema] AS A REAL JSON OBJECT, NOT A STRING:

CORRECT:
{
  "schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "title": "Project setup",
    "properties": {
      "db": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["Postgres", "SQLite", "MySQL"],
        "description": "Backend database"
      },
      "single_user": {
        "type": "boolean",
        "default": true,
        "description": "Only one user at a time?"
      }
    },
    "required": ["db"]
  }
}

WRONG (the schema must NOT be a JSON-encoded string):
{"schema": "{\"type\":\"object\", ...}"}
— that gets you an empty form. Pass the object inline.

Supported field types: string (with optional enum / pattern / format / minLength / maxLength), integer, number (with min / max), boolean, array of enum-string (renders as multi-select). Use [title] for the form heading, per-property [description] for help text, [required] to gate submit. Keep schemas small — one form per pause, 1–5 fields max. The user's answer comes back as a JSON-stringified object matching the schema, so parse it accordingly.

BACK-COMPAT — passing just [question: "..."] still works (auto-wrapped into a single-string-answer schema), but prefer the structured form whenever the answer space is constrained.

From the planner: prefer asking BEFORE decomposing the goal when scope is ambiguous (DB choice, framework choice, single- vs multi-user). Don't ask if you could reasonably decide yourself.`,

		// Neither field is required: the runtime accepts a schema or falls
		// back to question, and listing both as optional lets the model pick
		// without fighting a validator.
