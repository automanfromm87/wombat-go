// Package builtin is the built-in tool surface: the dozen tools an agent
// starts with.
//
// Every tool is a constructor, and every constructor takes its dependencies:
//
//	builtin.ViewFile(fsys)        // reads through an FS
//	builtin.Bash(runner)          // spawns through a Runner
//	builtin.HTTPGet(httpClient)   // fetches through an *http.Client
//	builtin.CurrentTime(time.Now) // reads a clock
//
// Nothing is ambient and nothing is global. A tool.Fn only ever receives a
// context and its JSON arguments, so whatever a tool needs to touch the
// outside world has to be captured when it is built. That is what makes a
// tool testable without a harness — builtin.ViewFile(fakeFS) is the whole
// setup — and what makes a restricted agent honest: hand it a sandboxed FS
// and there is no second path to the disk.
//
// The usual entry point is [Default], which builds all of them:
//
//	defs := builtin.Default(builtin.Deps{
//	    FS:   builtin.OSFS("/work/project"),
//	    Exec: builtin.OSRunner("/work/project"),
//	})
//	a, err := wombat.New(wombat.WithClient(c), wombat.WithTools(defs...))
//
// For a read-only sub-agent (verifier, planner), filter the result rather
// than hand-picking constructors — the tool list stays the single authority:
//
//	wombat.WithTools(tool.Filter(defs, tool.OnlyCaps(tool.CapReadOnly))...)
//
// which leaves view_file, grep_search, git_log, git_show, calculator and
// current_time.
//
// # Caps versus Needs
//
// grep_search, git_log and git_show all spawn a subprocess, yet none of them
// declares [tool.CapExec]. The distinction is deliberate and it is the one in
// tool.go: Cap is what a tool DOES, Need is what it requires from the host.
// These three run a fixed argv with a read-only effect, so they are
// CapReadOnly (and therefore survive the verifier filter above) while
// declaring NeedExec so a host without a subprocess facility hides them.
// bash, which runs whatever the model wrote, is CapExec|CapMutating|CapNetwork
// — it can curl — but declares only NeedExec|NeedFSRead|NeedFSWrite, because a
// host with no network can still offer a perfectly useful shell.
//
// # Which tools are retried
//
// [tool.WithRetry] fires only when a Def is BOTH Idempotent and carries a
// Retryable classifier, so the two fields together are the whole policy:
//
//   - The idempotent tools that touch the OS classify. view_file uses retryFS;
//     grep_search, git_log and git_show use retryExec. All four are read-only
//     with an argv or a path this package builds, so replaying one is free.
//   - The pure tools — calculator, current_time — leave Retryable nil. There is
//     no transient failure mode to catch; a retry would buy a second identical
//     answer at the price of wall clock.
//   - The mutating tools — write_file, str_replace, save_tool_result — and bash
//     are not idempotent, which is what actually forbids the replay. A write
//     that timed out may well have landed.
//
// http_get is the one classifier that is not about errnos: see retryHTTP.
