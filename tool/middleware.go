// Jitter is the one exception worth knowing: because zero is indistinguishable
// from unset, a NEGATIVE Jitter is how you ask for none. Deterministic backoff
// is almost never what you want when a batch of tool calls fails together —
// they would all wake at the same instant and hammer the same failing
// dependency.

//
// The values are tuned for tools, not for the model API: tool failures worth

// STOPPED: exec.CommandContext kills the child, an http.Request is aborted, a
// select on ctx.Done returns. This is one of the concrete wins over the OCaml
// original, which ran the tool on a thread it had no safe way to interrupt and
// simply abandoned it on timeout — the tool kept running, kept holding its
// file handles and sockets, and the middleware was excluded from the default

//     which of its failures are worth another go. Nil means never, which is
//     the conservative default: most tool errors ("no such file", "missing
//     field") are perfectly deterministic.
//
// A provider hint (llm.RetryAfter, present when the tool wrapped an HTTP call)
// raises the delay but never lowers it. The sleep is cancellable; if the run

//
// The state is PER PROCESS, deliberately, and this is the opposite choice from
// [WithDedupRepeats] — read the two together, because it is an easy pair to get
// backwards. A breaker guards an external dependency, and a dependency that is
// down is down for every run: if run A has just established that the search
// index refuses ten connections in a row, run B starting a second later gains
// nothing by rediscovering it, and the cooldown exists precisely to stop that
// rediscovery. Dedup counts something else entirely — how stuck ONE
// conversation is — which is why it lives on the context.
//
// The counters therefore live in this closure, captured when the chain is
// built, and the chain is built once per agent. Two agents get two breakers,
// which is the right granularity: they may well be pointed at different hosts.
//
// Position matters: it sits OUTSIDE WithRetry, so the count is of logical
// failures rather than of attempts — otherwise a single retried call could
// trip a threshold-3 breaker by itself.
//
// A failure that arrives with the context already dead is NOT counted: the run
// is being torn down and the tool is not at fault. Counting those would leave
// the breaker open at the start of the next run that shares the chain.
//
// Neither is a [CallerFault] — a rejected path, a malformed argument, a
// command that exited non-zero. Those report a healthy tool answering a bad
// question, and counting them is how a breaker ends up punishing the one
// participant who can still fix the situation. See [IsCallerFault] for why the
