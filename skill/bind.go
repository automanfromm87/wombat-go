// surface, the middleware that enforces it, and the system-prompt index.

// seams of the harness and one of them (Index) is a string that has to reach
// the prompt before the first call. See the package doc for the wiring.

// appeared in turn 3 is still sitting in the transcript at turn 30, models
// routinely call from memory, and a provider will happily forward a call for a
// tool absent from the current list. Without this layer, gating is a
// suggestion.

// iteration and an error it cannot costs the run.
