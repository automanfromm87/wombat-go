// State is one run's activation set: which skills are loaded, and which
// tool_result carried each one's body.
//
// Per-run, not per-agent. A wombat.Agent is immutable and shared across
// goroutines, so activations stored on it would leak between concurrent runs —
// one run loading pdf-forms would reveal fill_pdf to every other. The state
// travels on the context instead, which also means a sub-agent that inherits
// the context inherits the parent's loaded skills for free.
//
// The OCaml original held this in a module-global behind an algebraic effect,
// with a shared default for callers outside a handler. A context value is the
// same idea with less machinery and no fallback that silently couples tests.
